Translation Exercise of Proust: Francais->English

-- rooms of summer where one loves to be united with the tepid night, where the
moonlight leaned to the half-open blinds, throws at the foot of the bed its
enchanted ladder, where one sleeps almost in open air, like a tit [i.e.
chickadee] rocked by a breeze at the tip of a ray of light;


====================  p.53 =================
Combray from afar, about ten leagues in circumference, viewed from the train
when we arrived there the week before Easter, it was only a church epitomizing
the town, representing it, speaking from it and for it at a distance, and, when
one approached, holding pinched around its high somber mantle, in the open field, 
against the wind, like a shepherdress her sheeps, the woollen and gray backs
of gathered houses which a remnant of the ramparts of the Middle Ages
encircled here and there with a line as perfectly circular as a small town in a
primitive painting.

To live in, Combray was a little gloomy, as its streets on which the houses
constructed in blackish stones of the country, preceeded by exterior steps, 
covered by gables which pulled down the shades in front of them,
were so dark that one needs as soon as the day started to set to raise the 
blinds of the "rooms"; streets in grave names of the saints (of many masters of
Combray): rue Saint-Hilaire, rue Saint-Jaques on which was my aunt's house, rue
Sainte-Hildegarde, on which gave way the grill gate, and rue du Saint-Esprit on
which opened the little lateral garden gate; and these streets of Combray
existed in a part of my memory so reclused, painted by the colors so different
from those which now adorn the world for me, that in truth they all seem to me,
and the church which dominates them at the Square, more unreal still than the
projections of the magic lantern; and that at certain moments, it seems to me
that I still could traverse the rue Saint-Hilaire, could rent a room rue de
l'Oiseau -- at the old hotellerie de l'Oiseau Flesche, from the basement windows
of which came up an odour of cuisine that still rises every now and then in me
as intermittent and as warm -- would be an entrance in contact with the beyond
more marvellously supernatural than to make the acquaintance of Golo and to
talk with Genevieve de Brabant.
